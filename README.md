# example-3D-animation-with-rgl

This is a couple of 'simple' examples for visualising some typical files I work with, namely, netcdfs and shapefiles.  
Hopefully the code is easy to follow, understand and re-use.  

If you notice an error, or a way these examples can be improved, please contribute so these get better and easier to understand.

Cheers,
Tom
